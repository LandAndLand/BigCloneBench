BigCloneBench
=============

BigCloneBench is now available for download.  Distributable is a postgresql database. It can be loaded using pg_restore. The database expects the name 'bigclonebench' and owner 'postgresql'.  The SQL file may need to be modified to change these defaults. Otherwise they may be changed after restore.

Also available is the IJaDataset 2.0 with the additions required for this benchmark (the sample functions per functionality).
